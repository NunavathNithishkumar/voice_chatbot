43.  What is RBI Purpose Code?
The RBI Purpose Code refers to a code issued by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) that is used to classify the nature of foreign currency transactions. Each cross-border transaction is assigned a purpose code to help regulators and authorities understand the specific purpose of the transaction. The purpose code is mandatory for all cross-border payments in India and provides important information for compliance and reporting purposes.
 
44.  Which purpose code to use where. How to decide the purpose code?
You can visit Trusty Money's purpose code guide to get detailed information on the purpose codes and how to correctly assign the appropriate purpose code for your specific transactions. Trusty Money's purpose code guide simplifies the compliance process and provides guidance to help you ensure that you comply with the regulations and guidelines set by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) for cross-border transactions. By following the purpose code guide, you can simplify your compliance efforts and ensure that you correctly assign the appropriate purpose codes for your transactions.
 
45.  What Happens When You Choose the Wrong Purpose Code?
If you choose the wrong purpose code for your cross-border transactions, there can be several potential consequences. The central bank may flag the transactions as an attempt to evade taxes, which can result in scrutiny or penalties. Additionally, selecting the wrong purpose code can cause transaction failures or delays, as the transaction may not be properly classified and processed. In some cases, the bank may suspend the funds associated with the transaction on charges of tax evasion, and you may be subject to further investigation or legal action. If the transaction involves a significant amount of money, the risk of financial loss due to incorrect purpose code selection increases. It's important to note that once a purpose code is assigned to a transaction, it may be difficult or impossible to change it for previous transactions. Therefore, it is crucial to carefully select the correct purpose code to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements and avoid any potential negative consequences.
 
46.  What if my transaction’s purpose code not supported by Trusty Money?
Trusty Money supports majority of transactions’ purpose codes. Since, it is following the central bank directives, certain transactions are not processed via us and we therefore request you to proceed with your bank for processing those transactions.
